# FileTagger
FileTagger is a standalone Windows application (.exe) for bulk-renaming files and flattening folder structures. It is especially helpful for organizing large collections of photos, documents, or any other files by adding consistent, customizable suffixes (e.g., year, custom text, folder name, or sequential numbers).
